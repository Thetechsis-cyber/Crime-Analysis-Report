# INTRODUCTION:

This report presents an analysis of crime rates in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom from 2021 to 2023. The countries span diverse regions and socioeconomic contexts—together comprising hundreds of millions of people and a wide range of structures.

However, stark socioeconomic disparities, variations in law‑enforcement capacity, and differing legal frameworks drive significant fluctuations in crime rates. Persistent levels of violent crime (anti-social behavior, drug and illegal substances, possession of weapons,
robbery and mugging, violence and sexual offences), property crime (burglary, bicycle theft, criminal damage and arson, shoplifting, theft from a person, vehicle crime), pose complex challenges for public safety and justice systems alike.

This dashboard aims to uncover the underlying patterns and drivers of each crime
type—spotlighting geographic hotspots, shifts over time, and emerging offense
categories.

## KEY METRICS:

1. What is Crime Distribution by Year and Yearly Changes

### ANALYSIS:

### What is Crime Distribution by Year and Yearly Changes?

Total recorded crimes nearly tripled from 405 in 2021 to 1,150 in 2022  - indicating a sudden escalation in offending or improvements in reporting/recording that year.  Crime dropped by about to 945 incidents in 2023, suggesting some mitigation efforts took hold or external factors eased, yet levels remain more than twice the 2021 baseline. Even with the 2023 decline, crime remains high relative to 2021, signaling that underlying risk factors or systemic issues continue to exert pressure.

### What is Total Resolved and Unresolved Crimes?

The resolved rate of crimes has reached 70.04% as a result of government effort while a significant portion, accounting for 29.96% of crime incidence is unresolved.

### How is Crime Distributed by Weekdays and Months?

Crime rises steadily from August (195) into September (254) and peaks sharply in October (309), before dropping back to more moderate levels in November and December.There are secondary peaks in March (209) and May (208).February records the lowest total (175), with January (187) and December (187) also on the lower end, indicating a relative crime.

## RECOMMENDATION

-	Strengthen community engagement and social supports
-	Invest in youth programs, job training, and anti poverty measures to address drivers of property and violent crime.
-	 Launch “late night watch” neighborhood patrols and volunteer escort schemes for residents vulnerable at pre dawn hours.
-	Concentrate uniformed and plain clothes patrols from 9 PM-3 AM, rotating shifts so officers are fresh for the late night surge.
-	Improve street lighting and CCTV coverage especially around nightlife districts, transit hubs, and poorly lit residential areas.
-	Targeted stop and search operations to reduce illegal possession.
-	 Outreach programs in schools and community centers focusing on consent, bystander intervention, and conflict resolution.
-	 install emergency call boxes where needed.
-	Coordinate with local businesses to share intelligence on recurring trouble spots and time
-	Mediation services for neighborhood disputes before they spill into public disturbances.
